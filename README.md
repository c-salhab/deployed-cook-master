# Cook Master Project üçΩÔ∏èüçó

For the second year annual project in development, we had to create a website for a cooking company. This company aims to sell certified courses that are provided by external providers such as renowned chefs. The site provides a wide range of features such as the purchase of materials, lessons, certified courses or even the possibility of registering for an organized event. A shopping cart is available to sort all the desired objects.
